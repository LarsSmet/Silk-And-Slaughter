# Introduction
Play as a deadly spider on a mission to infiltrate and destroy the ant nest in 'Silk And Slaughter'. Navigate through a maze of treacherous tunnels, overcome ant hordes and find the queen and her eggs. Your mission is clear: eradicate the queen and ensure the destruction of her future ant soldiers.

This was an assignment for the course Game Mechanics at DAE. It was the first time that I worked in Unity and I instantly fell in love with the engine. I had a really fun time working on this project and it really sparked my interest in game design and prototyping.

# Goal
During class, we got 2 keywords. I had the keywords: "find and destroy" and "nest". We had to brainstorm and come up with an interesting game using these keywords. These keywords instantly sparked some ideas, after brainstorming, I came up with the idea of infiltrating an ant nest, where you had to find and destroy the queen and her eggs. My goal was to make a unique game concept and to make some cool mechanics around the spider.

# Story
Spiders and ants have been at war for a long time now in the insect realm. The ants are overpopulating, making them a big threat. You are a spider, it's your job to infiltrate ant nests and destroy their colony. You do this by killing the queen and destroying all her eggs. But be careful, because the ants will do anything to save their queen.
