# Introduction
Play as a deadly spider on a mission to infiltrate and destroy the ant nest in 'Spider vs Ants'. Navigate through a maze of treacherous tunnels, overcome ant hordes and find the queen and her eggs. Your mission is clear: eradicate the queen and ensure the destruction of her future ant soldiers.

This was an assignment for the course Game Mechanics at DAE. It was the first time that I worked in Unity and I instantly fell in love with the engine. I had a really fun time working on this project and it really sparked my interest in game design and prototyping.

# Goal
During class, we got 2 keywords. I had the keywords: "find and destroy" and "nest". We had to brainstorm and come up with an interesting game using these keywords. These keywords instantly sparked some ideas, after brainstorming, I came up with the idea of infiltrating an ant nest, where you had to find and destroy the queen and her eggs. My goal was to make a unique game concept and to make some cool mechanics around the spider.
