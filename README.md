# Introduction
Play as a deadly spider on a mission to infiltrate and destroy the ant nest in 'Silk And Slaughter'. Navigate through a maze of treacherous tunnels, overcome ant hordes and find the queen and her eggs. Your mission is clear: eradicate the queen and ensure the destruction of her future ant soldiers.

This was an assignment for the course Game Mechanics at DAE. It was the first time that I worked in Unity and I instantly fell in love with the engine. I had a really fun time working on this project and it really sparked my interest in game design and prototyping.

# Goal
During class, we got 2 keywords. I had the keywords: "find and destroy" and "nest". We had to brainstorm and come up with an interesting game using these keywords. These keywords instantly sparked some ideas, after brainstorming, I came up with the idea of infiltrating an ant nest, where you had to find and destroy the queen and her eggs. My goal was to make a unique game concept and to make some cool mechanics around the spider.

# Story
Spiders and ants have been at war for a long time now in the insect realm. The ants are overpopulating, making them a big threat. You are a spider, it's your job to infiltrate ant nests and destroy their colony. You do this by killing the queen and destroying all her eggs. But be careful, because the ants will do anything to save their queen.


# Gameplay and mechanics
I wanted the spider to have some cool abilities that use his web. When the player right-clicks he shoots his web. What this does depends on which ability the player equips.
## Bite
Of course, the spider needs a basic attack. The player left clicks to bite in front of him and damages all ants hit.
## Blind
The player equips his blind ability by pressing 1. If it hits a spider this will temporarily blind them. Which will make them unable to attack or move. This is great to take out a single, or small group of ants. This only costs 1 web.

## Mark
The player equips his mark ability by pressing 2. If it hits a wall it will put a marker on it. This helps the player to find his way back in the maze of tunnels in the end nest. This only costs 1 web.

## Cobweb
The player equips his cobweb ability by pressing 3. If this hits the ground it will cover an area in web. If enemies walk over it, they will get slowed, until they eventually get fully stunned. When the cobweb runs out, the enemies gain their movement back. This ability is great to take out larger groups of ants, but it also uses 3 webs, which is more than the other abilities.

I was really happy with this mechanic. As it really represents how a web works in real life. The more you try to get out of it, the more you get stuck until eventually they can't move anymore.

## Destroying the queen and her eggs
The goal is obviously destroying the queen and her eggs. You have to look for them through all the tunnels whilst surviving all the ants attacking you. The queen is harder to kill and stronger than the other ants. The eggs are destroyable by biting them. After doing so, the ants will seek revenge. Tons of ants will spawn in your path, trying to stop you from escaping the nest.

## Pickups
There are web and health pickups throughout the level that will restore your web ammo and health.

# Improvements and what's next
One day I hope to revisit this project, because I really like the concept, even tho it was one of my first prototypes I ever made. Some polishing like animations on the bite and more player feedback when getting hit would be great. But these are more like finishing touches, there are definitely some improvements and additions that I could make to the general gameplay.

One thing that I am not that happy about is the level design. I didn't put a lot of thought behind it at the time, but after gaining more experience throughout the years, I realise that this is actually really important and completely changes the way the game is played. Right now it is very big and all at the same level. If I would remake it today, I would really experiment with height differences. It adds so much more and could also introduce new mechanics. I would also pay more attention to the maze part, making it hard to find the ant queen, which would also make the mark ability more valuable. Also making it darker, the rooms smaller and the halls narrower would also give a more thrilling vibe to the game.

I also had some other abilities planned, like for example an ability where if you hit an ant, you could pull it towards you and kill it. Or another ability that kind of works like a grappling hook. There are lots of possibilities, so I really hope I can find the opportunity someday to remake this project.
